# Skills

Loadable, runnable procedures — the *how* that pairs with the playbooks' *why*. Each skill is a
self-contained `SKILL.md` an agent loads when it enters that phase. They're written generically:
they read your project's [`config.yaml`](../setup/config.template.yaml) for the specifics.

## How skills are written here
- **Generic, not project-specific.** A skill says "read the test command from config and run it,"
  not a hardcoded command. Your `config.yaml` supplies the specifics.
- **Trigger + steps + pitfalls + verification.** Each skill states when to load it, numbered steps,
  the traps to avoid, and how to confirm it worked.
- **Linked both ways.** The skill points back to its playbook for the reasoning; the playbook points
  to the skill for the procedure.

## Adapting a skill to your agent runtime
These `SKILL.md` files are runtime-agnostic. If your agent framework has its own skill format, the
body translates directly — the structure (trigger / steps / pitfalls / verification) is what
matters, not the file convention.
