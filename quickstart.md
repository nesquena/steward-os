# Quickstart: adopt Steward in ~15 minutes
{: .fs-8 }

Get an agent co-maintaining your repo, in supervised mode, on Claude Code. No autonomy yet -
this is the on-ramp: read the model, wire the config, run one loop by hand, then climb.
{: .fs-5 .fw-300 }

## Before you start

- **Claude Code** installed and working in your repo.
- A **GitHub repository** you maintain, with the **`gh` CLI** authenticated (`gh auth status`).
- **Steward checked out locally** (`git clone https://github.com/nesquena/steward-os`) - you'll copy its skills in step 2.
- ~15 minutes and an open issue or PR you can practice on.

You do **not** need any autonomy, scheduled jobs, or a chat integration to start. Those come later,
on the [adoption ladder](docs/reference/adoption-levels.md).

## 1. Read the model (5 min)

Skim the [architecture overview](docs/architecture/index.md) - the four roles, the autonomy bands,
and the one idea everything rests on: *reading is cheap; writing to a public surface in the
project's voice is the irreversible act that stays human-gated.* You don't need the whole site yet.

## 2. Get the skills into your repo

Copy Steward's loadable procedures into your repo's Claude Code skills directory:

```bash
# from your project root, with steward-os checked out alongside it
mkdir -p .claude/skills
cp -R /path/to/steward-os/skills/* .claude/skills/
```

Claude Code discovers these on next launch. They're the procedures the setup interview and the
lifecycle playbooks tell the agent to load.

## 3. Wire it to your project

In Claude Code, load the **`project-system-setup`** skill and say:

> run the setup interview

The agent works through the [setup interview](setup/setup-interview.md) - your repos, scope anchors,
CI, review tools, autonomy posture - and writes a `config.yaml` for your project. It asks only what
it needs, accepts "skip" for anything optional, and never guesses.

To see a finished one, read Steward's own
[`setup/config.yaml`](https://github.com/nesquena/steward-os/blob/main/setup/config.yaml), which
configures this repo.

## 4. Prove it with one supervised loop (Level 1)

Pick an open issue or PR. Ask the agent to run the matching playbook **in a supervised session** -
you watch, it proposes, you approve every public write:

- An issue → load `issue-triage`, ask it to triage that issue and draft (not post) a reply.
- A PR → load `pr-triage`, ask it to run the [fit screen](docs/lifecycle/pr-lifecycle.md#0-fit--scope-screen)
  and summarize.

Nothing is posted without your say-so. That's Level 1: the playbooks run in supervised sessions, so
you get value on day one without handing over any autonomy.

## 5. Climb

You've done the read→run step. From here you add capability deliberately, one rung at a time:

- **Level 2:** a read-only [triage scoreboard](docs/playbooks/triage-scoreboard.md) and digests.
- **Level 3:** promote mechanical, reversible, watched actions to autonomy behind the
  [watchdog pattern](docs/playbooks/watchdog-pattern.md).
- **Level 4:** the full pipeline.

See the [adoption levels](docs/reference/adoption-levels.md) for the whole ladder, and
[Steward on Steward](docs/reference/steward-on-steward.md) to see it applied to this repo.
